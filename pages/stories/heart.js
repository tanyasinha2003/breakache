          Life doesn’t always follow the script we envision, and love—beautiful,
          unpredictable love—can sometimes lead us to unexpected heartbreak.
          We’ve all visited that place of pain, where our hearts feel shattered,
          and the world feels heavy.
        </p>

        <p className="mx-[2rem] lg:mx-[20rem] my-[1rem] text-center">
          In a time when more people are choosing authenticity over compromise,
          relationships and even marriages are evolving. This shift brings both
          freedom and challenges, reminding us that love doesn’t always mean
          staying—it can also mean letting go.

        <p className="mx-[2rem] lg:mx-[20rem] my-[1rem] text-center">
          But heartbreak isn’t just an end; it’s also an opportunity. An
          opportunity to rediscover ourselves, to grow, and to embrace the
          courage it takes to start anew. Every ending has the potential to be a
          beginning, a step toward a life that’s even more aligned with who you
          are.

          share their journeys through heartbreak and the strength they found on
          the other side. Your story could inspire someone else to find their
