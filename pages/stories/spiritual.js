          Our beliefs are shaped by the lessons and traditions we grow up with,
          forming the foundation of how we view the world and our place within
          it. But life, with its unexpected twists and turns, can sometimes
          challenge these deeply held convictions.

        <p className="mx-[2rem] lg:mx-[20rem] my-[1rem] text-center">
          A sudden loss, a profound experience, or even a moment of quiet
          reflection can lead us to question everything we once took for
          granted—including our faith and purpose. This spiritual break isn’t a
          failure; it’s an awakening. It’s a call to pause, reevaluate, and
          rediscover what truly resonates with our soul.
        </p>

        <p className="mx-[2rem] lg:mx-[20rem] my-[1rem] text-center">
          In these moments, we may feel lost, but it’s in the questioning that
          we often find clarity. It’s in breaking away that we find a deeper,
          more personal connection to what we truly believe.
        </p>
